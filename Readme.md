2. [Run application](#2-run-application)
3. [File structure](#3-file-structure)

# 1. Environment setup

Follow environment setting for Reactnative in [here](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup).

# 2. Run application

## Install dependencies

```
$ npm install
```

Run prettier to prettier generated code (optional)

```
$ npm run prettier
```

## Start application

To start the application in android device/emulator:

```
$ npm run android
```

or in IOS device/simulator:

```
$ npm run ios
```

You might need to configure some more to run your app in IOS, follow this [instruction](https://reactnative.dev/docs/running-on-device)

## Working with local back-end server (Android only)

You need to bind a port on your Android device to a port on your computer that allow Front-end application communicating with Back-end server.

Suppose that your back-end run at port 8080:

```
$ adb reverse tcp:8080 tcp:8080
```

# 3. File structure

While many files are generated by JDA which depend on content of DDD model, there exits a base high-level file structure that remains consistent for all ReactNative app:

## Structure
